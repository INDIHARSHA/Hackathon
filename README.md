# Advanced GenAI Internship – Entrance Test Tasks

This repository contains solutions and notes for the **Advanced GenAI Internship Entrance Test** conducted by Innomatics Research Labs.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is a merged file created from:
- `orders.json`
- `restaurants.json`
- `users.json`

Final merged dataset: **`final_food_delivery_dataset.csv`**

## 📝 Tasks
The following analysis tasks are covered:

1. **Which restaurant has the highest average order value but less than 20 total orders?**
2. **Which combination (membership + cuisine) contributes the highest revenue?**
3. **During which quarter of the year is the total revenue highest?**
4. **If a user has no matching record in `users.json`, the merged values will be NaN.**
5. **The Pandas function used to combine datasets based on a key is `pd.merge()`.**
6. **If a user places multiple orders, their personal details appear as many times as the number of orders they place.**

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
